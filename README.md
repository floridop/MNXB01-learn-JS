Once upon a time,
if there was a **beautiful** _princess_,
it would have looked like:

```
        w*W*W*W*w
         \"."."/
          //`\\
         (/a a\)
         (\_-_/) 
        .-~'='~-.
       /`~`"Y"`~`\
      / /(_ * _)\ \
     / /  )   (  \ \
     \ \_/\\_//\_/ / 
      \/_) '*' (_\/
        |       |
        |       |
        |       |
        |       |
        |       |
        |       |
        |       |
jgs     |       |
        w*W*W*W*w
```
